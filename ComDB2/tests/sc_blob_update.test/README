This test case concerns updating fields, especially blobs while schemachange is underway.

There are two issues, one is failing schemachange if the blob was null and now is not anymore.

The second is far more concerning, updating a record while there SC going on, triggers a codepath
which creates a new genid if record size is now larger than old record, thus the blobs and indices
will contain bad genid compared to the data file--the db would be corrupt.
