Perform additions onto table while doing schemachange to swap two 
fields order (which ordinarily is an instant SC), but in this case
add an index at the same time, so we will trigger rebuild and expose
issue with add record.

Existing BUGS being fixed:
- changing order of two fields causes bad data inserted as well as fails 
verify:

5845ef2400310007 ix 1 missing key
5845ef2400310007 ix 2 missing key
5845ef2400310007 ix 3 missing key
5845ef2400310007 ix 1 key mismatch
5845ef2400310007 ix 2 key mismatch
5845ef2400310007 ix 3 key mismatch


- changing order and adding an index fails schemachange because of add error:

live_sc_post_add_int rcode 2, genid 0x6002500c3fe4558
Aborting schema change due to unexpected error
