This test sets attribute sqlite_sorter_tempdir_reqfree which ensures
that the sqlsort_* tempfiles (created when there is an ORDER BY clause)
do not take over the disk space: when the free space is less
than sqlite_sorter_tempdir_reqfree flushing to those tmpfiles will 
return an I/O error to sqlite engine.

How this is set: sqlite/vdbesort.c calls comdb2_tmpdir_space_low() to check
if there is enough space in the fs, and returns failure if not enough space.
Note that the vdbe sorter files are written in a directory that looks like this:

tests/test_14037/limitsortingtbl14037/limitsortingtbl14037.tmpdbs/sqlsort_a75c893a53e014de

and the file is not visible via ls because it is opened with 
SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE. Doing lsof, the sqlsort_* files show up as DEL 
(deleted)
