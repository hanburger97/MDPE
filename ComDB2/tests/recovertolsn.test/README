This test exercises the ability to recover to a given lsn.

First we insert 200 rows into t1, storing the LSN.

Then we bounce the db to make sure we have those same 200 rows.

Then we insert/update/delete to make changes to the db.

Then we bounce the db recovering to the stored LSN, and make 
sure that we only see the original 200 rows in table t1.
